# MERN Stack App

This repository serves as a starting point for building a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application. It includes a basic setup with instructions to help you get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-stack-app.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash 
        cd mern-stack-app
    ```
3. Install dependencies using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
4. Set up your MongoDB database:

* Create a .env file in the root of the project.

* Add the following line to the .env file, replacing <YOUR_MONGODB_URI> with your MongoDB connection string:

    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=<YOUR_MONGODB_URI>
    ```
4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This will concurrently run the server and the React app.

5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

    ## Project Structure

    The project structure is organized as follows:

* `client`: React front-end application.
* `server`: Express.js back-end server.
* `config`: Configuration files.
* `models`: MongoDB models.
* `routes`: API routes.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this structure based on your project requirements.
